LLM Stages

1. Pre-training.
2. SFT finetune. 

Files to prompt is a utility manager to concatenate the content of many files into a prompt. This is useful because you can simply run the command and ask an LLM about it. 

This is interesting because there might be other places where X to prompt might make sense. For example, turning a website into a prompt, turning your notes into a prompt, turning a recipe, turning a photo, turning a video, anything is prompteable.

Idea: An email where you sent a work request and you get work outputs. They can be either through LLMs, or humans in the loop. Send an email and get it done.
