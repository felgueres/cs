**Electric current**   

Total charge passing through a cross-sectional area `A` per unit time. 

$\displaystyle I_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$

1 A = 1 C/s (Coulombs per second)

| Device | Current Draw |
|--------|--------------|
| Low-powered microchip | Î¼A or even pA |
| LED light | 20mA |
| Smartphone | 200mA |
| Current to induce cardiac arrest | 100mA to 1A |
| 100-W lightbulb | 1A |
| Electric fan | ~1A |
| Laptop | ~3A |
| Microwave | ~13A |
| Automobile starter | 200A |
| Lightning strike | 1000A |

**Voltage**

A voltage across a conductor creates an eletromotive force (EMF) that gives `free electrons` withing the conductor a push.

Direct Current voltage source (DC voltage source): A device that maintains a constant voltage across its terminals. 

> A battery generates EMF by chemical reactions that yield a buildup of free electrons in the negative terminal region, they repel each other and generate electrical pressure.
> By placing a load between the terminals, electrons attemp to alleviate the pressure by dispersing into the circuit.
> Even a small concentration gives rise to great repulsive forces between free electrons.
> The chain reaction or pulse when there's a release in tension travels down the conductor at near the speed of light.
