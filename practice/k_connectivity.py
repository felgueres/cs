Given an undirected connected graph, return a set of all bridges in the graph. 
A bridge is an edge of a graph whose removal disconnects the graph.

Input: Graph [edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)], n = 4]
Output: {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)}
Explanation: The graph has 3 bridges {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)}, since removal of any of it disconnects the graph.

Input: Graph [edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)], n = 4]
Output: {}
Explanation: The graph is 2â€“edge connected. i.e., it remains connected on removal of any edge.

Note: 
The solution should return edges in increasing order of node's value. 
For instance, both (1, 2) and (2, 1) represent the same edge in an undirected graph. 
The solution should return edge (1, 2).

Naive: Remove an edge and check if resulting graph is connected O(E * (V+E))

An edge (v,to) is a bridge iff none of the vertices `to` and its descendants in the DFS tree has a back-edge to vertex v or any ancestor.
Meaning that there's no way from `v` to `to` except for edge (v,to)

Ultimately you want to check that low[to] > tin[v] = 'is_bridge'
