Given an undirected graph, determine whether it is bipartite or not. A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided 
into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.

Input: Graph [edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (7, 8)], n = 9]
Output: True
Explanation: The graph is a bipartite as it can be divided it into two sets, U (0, 2, 4, 5, 7) and V (1, 3, 6, 8), with every edge having one endpoint in set U and the other in set V.

If we add edge 1 â€”> 3, the graph becomes non-bipartite.

Scenario:
- Undirected
- Unweighted
- Bipartiteness: Can you create two disjointed sets where every item of each set has a connection on the other
