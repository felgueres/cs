# Given an M Ã— N matrix of characters, find all occurrences of a given string in the matrix. 
# We are allowed to search the string in all eight possible directions, 
# i.e., North, West, South, East, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West. 
# Note that there should not be any cycles in the output path.

# This problem requires backtracking to track all possible solutions!
