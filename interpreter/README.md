# Interpreter

I've been wondering how do you go at building a new language. 
My suspicion is that the practical knowledge from building one will transfer to other skills.

So what are the steps to build an interpreter:

1) Lexer: Converts single characters into tokens
2) Parser: Creates a tree following language-specific grammar rules. 
3) Static analysis: <Unclear what this does>
